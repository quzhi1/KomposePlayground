## Helm

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.  Please refer to
Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

```bash
helm repo add kompose-playground https://quzhi1.github.io/KomposePlayground/charts
```

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve
the latest versions of the packages.  You can then run `helm search repo
kompose-playground` to see the charts.

To install the kompose-playground chart:

```bash
helm install kompose-playground kompose-playground/kompose-playground
```

To uninstall the chart:

```bash
  helm delete kompose-playground
```

## Updating Helm charts
```bash
mkdir -p charts
helm package kompose-playground --destination charts/
helm repo index charts
```
